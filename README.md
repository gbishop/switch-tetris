# Tetris AI

This project started life as Yiyuan Lee's
[Tetris AI](https://github.com/LeeYiyuan/tetrisai). I have modified it to make
an accessible version of Tetris for players who use two switches or EyeGaze for
input.

On each round the computer offers what the algorithm determines to be the best
move and worst move as determined by Yiyuan's algorithm. The player uses Space
or Right Arrow to choose which move they want and Enter or Left Arrow to drop
the piece.
